Get Kaneo up and running on your own infrastructure in minutes. Kaneo is an open-source project management tool designed to help teams collaborate efficiently. With just a few commands, you can deploy both the frontend and backend using Docker Compose.


## Installation

<Steps>

1. Create a `compose.yml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml title="compose.yaml"
   services:
    backend:
      image: ghcr.io/kaneo-app/api:latest
      environment:
        JWT_ACCESS: "change_me"
        DB_PATH: "/app/apps/api/data/kaneo.db"
      ports:
        - 1337:1337
      restart: unless-stopped
      volumes:
        - sqlite_data:/app/apps/api/data

    frontend:
      image: ghcr.io/kaneo-app/web:latest
      environment:
        KANEO_API_URL: "http://localhost:1337"
      ports:
        - 5173:80
      depends_on:
        - backend
      restart: unless-stopped
      
  volumes:
    sqlite_data:
   ```

2. Run the following command in the directory containing your `compose.yml`:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

3. This will start both the Kaneo frontend and backend. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. Here are the key environment variables you need to configure:

    | Variable | Description | Required |
    |----------|-------------|----------|
    | `KANEO_API_URL` | The url of the API | Yes |
    | `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for JWT tokens | Yes |

4. You’re done! 🎉
